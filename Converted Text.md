  Molecular Docking is a computer-assisted drug design model and a vital tool for drug discovery towards predicting the binding affinity between receptors and ligands. During docking"lock and key model" , which refers to the internal geometry of the receptor and the ligand to find the correct orientation for the"key" to open up the "lock" kept fixed. The realflexible docking process  in which the receptor and ligands change their conformation to fit each other is called an"induced fit model".

         Molecular docking simulations are generally used for reproducing the experimental data through docking validations algorithms, where protein-protein or protein-ligand conformations are obtained by using in silico method. Docking is one of the main toolsfor virtual screening procedures. By using this method a library of several compounds is "docked" alongside one drug target and proceeds to the best hit .

It is a structure-based drug-designing method that generally stimulates molecular interaction for predicting the binding modeusingshape and electrostatic interactions like van der Waals & Coulombic interactions .          The sum of all these interactions is calculated by a docking score. Various MD software is available to find the best orientation and optimal conformation according to pre-organization and specific complementarity with a definite algorithm, followed by a scoring function to calculate the binding affinity . The most widely used MD software is Flex X: fragmentation algorithm, Gold: genetic algorithm, Glide: Exhaustive Systematic search, AutoDock: genetic algorithm & Lamarckian genetic algorithm, ZDOCK: Geometric complementarity & molecular dynamics, RDOCK: genetic algorithm, MC (monte carlo) & MIN (Simplex minimization, LeDOCK: Simulated annealing (SA) & Genetic algorithm (GA) followed by AutodockVina: GA genetic algorithm (9). The three main distinct forms of MD are Rigid Docking, Flexible-rigid Docking, and Flexible (soft) Docking. The most widely used software is Flexible-rigid Docking because of its accuracy. We can analyze the interactive mode of protein-DNA docking with the help of AutodockVina, which is displayed in PyMOL Since the 1980s, the molecular docking approach has been widely used to predict the interaction between two proteins, identify the ligand binding pocket, and predict the interaction(s) between a protein and a small molecule. Now a day's, the development of drug discovery computational docking simulation is the need of today's research. 

The impact of molecular Docking is well recognized and established in pharmaceutical industries. Day by day, molecular docking-based virtual screening is growing and significantly enhanced towards the recognition of new lead candidates.

 This work analyzed the global literature on Molecular Docking (MD) conducted in the last ten years, from 2013 to 2022, using bibliometric methods. Review of Literature MD research started in the early 1980's, with the establishment of the Molecular Graphics Society in 1982. The major role of Society is to support anddevelop research towards designing bioactive molecules (Willett, 2007). In 2016, Agarwal and Mehrotra reported thatMD helps to form a stable complex by predicting the preferred binding orientation of the ligand to the receptor using novel computational tools and techniques.It aims to attain an optimized docked conformer for ligand and receptor molecules  in their study discussed the commonly applied methods in computational biology, drug design, computational chemistry, and material science. Computer-aided drug design and discovery (CADDD) plays a major role towards drug discovery and development. The use and application of computational methods have facilitated the proliferation of biological databases and become an early driving force for developing MD techniques towards drug designing . Molecular Docking is the future of medicinal research as reported recently .

This study tries to assess global works of literature on MD using bibliometrics methods based on data retrieved from the Scopes. In 1963, Pritchard stated that bibliometrics is the application of mathematical and statistical methods for quantitative data analysis that extracts patterns from publications such as the growth of publication, journal impact, citations patterns, authorship in the literature, and so on . Bibliometrics comprises a set of methods to examine or measure books, articles and other publications. In recent decades, Bibliometrics has been considered a standard science policy and research management tool

 It is generally applied to scientific fields to quantitatively measure the various aspects of literature like subject, author, citations, affiliation, country, etc. 

 The study identifies the prominent and impactful

(a)authors,

(b)geographic regions, 

(c)research institutions, 

(d)scholarly documents, 

(e)significant keywords and research topics, 

(f) highly cited countries,

(g) most publishing sources that have been highly influential in the field over the last ten years.

      Bibliometric indicators like authorship patterns, citation statistics, and bibliometric techniques are useful for decision-making and tracking the evolution of science and technology . For specific scientific research, bibliometric studies comprehensively assess and help to identify the number and distribution of publications related to authorship, co-authorship, most cited articles etc.Overthe past few decades, several bibliometric and scientometric approaches have been adopted by researchers to study computational researchin different areas . But there is no bibliometric studies have been conducted on Molecular Docking yet. This work is entirely new and innovative.

      The main objectives of this study are to provide a systematic overview of MD by employing the bibliometrics methods based on information retrieved from the Scopes database.
